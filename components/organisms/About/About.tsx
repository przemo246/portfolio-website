              I&apos;m a passionate front-end developer with commercial
              experience however I also enjoy bulding projects in my free time.
              I have finished a 240 hour front-end bootcamp at{" "}

              in 2021 and apart from that I have spent many, many hours more
              perfecting my front-end skills on my own. I focus mostly on
              JavaScript, TypeScript and React however I am very open-minded
              about tools that I use. Apart from front-end programming I am also
              very keen to dig deeper into server-side programming as well as
              web3 tools and frameworks.
